    CONSOLE APPLICATION : MochaLang Project Overview
========================================================================

Mocha-Lang is a proprietary scripting language created for use in game engines,
The main goal is native method call capabilities which do not compromise
the integrity of low level game engine code, being able to call native functions
will eliminate the need to expose parts of your engine which makes reverse engineering
and hacking or modding harder without a proper modding SDK.
